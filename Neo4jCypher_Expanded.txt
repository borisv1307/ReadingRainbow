Expansive Neo4j DB Testing

In order to test multiple intersecting Books, Libraries and Wish Lists, a more elaborate database is needed. As before, download and install Neo4j desktop (if you have not already), set 
up a local database, and import the associated Neo4jDB_expansive_Testingv1.4 csv file. Be sure to copy your local file URL and insert into LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM statement.

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'http://localhost:11001/project-32e06daf-0ca3-47a0-91f0-8b4cc74c1ebc/Neo4jDB_expansive_Testing_v1.4.csv' AS line

create (b:Book {thumbnail:"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QdNU9CFJXxEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", author:"Jane K. Brown", description:"In an impressively comparative work, Jane K. Brown explores the tension in European drama between allegory and neoclassicism from the sixteenth through the nineteenth century. Imitation of nature is generally thought to triumph over religious allegory in the Elizabethan and French classical theater, a shift attributable to the recovery of Aristotle's Poetics in the Renaissance. But if Aristotle's terminology was rapidly assimilated, Brown demonstrates that change in dramatic practice took place only gradually and partially and that allegory was never fully cast off the stage. The book traces a complex history of neoclassicism in which new allegorical forms flourish and older ones are constantly revitalized. Brown reveals the allegorical survivals in the works of such major figures as Shakespeare, Calderón, Racine, Vondel, Metastasio, Goethe, and Wagner and reads tragedy, comedy, masque, opera, and school drama together rather than as separate developments. Throughout, she draws illuminating parallels to modes of representation in the visual arts. A work of broad interest to scholars, teachers, and students of theatrical form, The Persistence of Allegory presents a fundamental rethinking of the history of European drama.", id:"QdNU9CFJXxEC", title:"The Persistence of Allegory"})

The only mysteries she faces are which play to choose for next season and how to decorate her dining room. But when Jack is hired to investigate a suspicious death at a San Francisco software company, it quickly becomes clear that high-tech has some low-life elements. The only way Charley knows how to help Jack involves doing something no-body thought she would ever do. Charley needs to get a job. It might be a problem that Charley and her band of irregulars from the repertory theater learned everything they know about the workplace from a production of How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, but that doesn't stop them from going undercover to find a killer. And even though she's only had one day's training in corporate double-speak, Charley isn't worried. Faking it has always been her strong suit. Charley and Jack are starting to get the hang of this marriage thing. If only people would stop talking about babies, introducing them to decorators, and trying to kill them, they might even get to take a honeymoon.", id:"nhR58UIH1N4C", title:"How to Succeed in Murder"})

Heard", description:"The ability to write clearly is critical to any scientific career. The Scientist's Guide to Writing provides practical advice to help scientists become more effective writers so that their ideas have the greatest possible impact. Drawing on his own experience as a scientist, graduate adviser, and editor, Stephen Heard emphasizes that the goal of all scientific writing should be absolute clarity; that good writing takes deliberate practice; and that what many scientists need are not long lists of prescriptive rules but rather direct engagement with their behaviors and attitudes when they write. He combines advice on such topics as how to generate and maintain writing momentum with practical tips on structuring a scientific paper, revising a first draft, handling citations, responding to peer reviews, managing coauthorships, and more. In an accessible, informal tone, The Scientist's Guide to Writing explains essential techniques that students, postdoctoral researchers, and early-career scientists need to write more clearly, efficiently, and easily. Emphasizes writing as a process, not just a product Encourages habits that improve motivation and productivity Explains the structure of the scientific paper and the function of each part Provides detailed guidance on submission, review, revision, and publication Addresses issues related to coauthorship, English as a second language, and more", id:"gW6YDwAAQBAJ", title:"The Scientist's Guide to Writing"})

As printing technology moves forward at an equally fast pace, the new inkjet printers are capable of printing with great precision at a very fine resolution, providing an amazing tonal range and significantly superior image permanence at a more affordable price. In the hands of knowledgeable photographers, these printers are able to produce prints that are comparable to the highest quality darkroom prints on fine art paper. The third edition of this best-selling book provides the necessary foundation for successful fine art printing: the understanding of color management, profiling, paper, and inks. It offers advice on selecting an appropriate printer for long-lasting fine art prints, demonstrates how to set up the printing workflow and select a suitable paper for your subject, and guides you step-by-step through the process of converting an image file to an outstanding fine art print. This new edition covers the most recent lines of high-end inkjet printers, photo papers, and devices for monitor and printer profiling. It also addresses the printing dialogs and some new features of Photoshop CS6.", id:"vj24BAAAQBAJ", title:"Fine Art Printing for Photographers"})

It begins with a critical assessment of the different ways in which popular music has been studied and the difficulties and debates which surround the analysis of popular culture and popular music. Drawing on the recent work of music scholars and the popular music press, Shuker explores key subjects which shape our experience of music, including music production, the music industry, music policy, fans, audiences and subcultures, the musician as 'star', music journalism, and the reception and consumption of popular music.

Next, create FRIENDS_WITH relations. Notice in this case, we use single Direction friend relationships at the database layer but at the query language layer, we ignore directionality (or in other words,
use bi-directional queries). 

For instance, MATCH (p1:Person)-[r:FRIENDS_WITH]-(p2:Person) is the same as
MATCH (p1:Person)-[r:FRIENDS_WITH]->(p2:Person) AND MATCH (p2:Person)-[r:FRIENDS_WITH]->(p1:Person).
Where bi-directional relationships are implicit (or explicit) as in the case of friends, we model such using single FRIENDS_WITH relationship with arbitrary direction.

MATCH (p1:Person), (p2:Person) WHERE p1.Name="Siegfried Kircheis" AND p2.Name="Wolfgang Mittermeyer"
CREATE (p1)-[r:FRIENDS_WITH]->(p2)
RETURN p1,p2

MATCH (p1:Person), (p2:Person) WHERE p1.Name="Siegfried Kircheis" AND p2.Name="Hildegard von Mariendorf"

Alternatively, for more advanced Cypher users, you may use:
MATCH (p1:Person {Name: "Dusty Attenborough"}), (p2:Person {Name: "Oskar von Reuenthal"})
